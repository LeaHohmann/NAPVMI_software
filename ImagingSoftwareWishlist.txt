Control delay generator
    read back the delay values from BNC box (before changing them)
    set delays on BNC box
    choose one channel to scan, set initial and final value, step size (alternative would be number of steps but then you get weird step sizes)



Control camera
    read and set gain, exposure time, x and y pixels if we don't want to use/save the whole image
    set the number of images to sum
    check if we saturate the camera or file format at high signal
    take a single image
    display the live image (rolling average of last x shots? lots more memory? good for low signal)
    display the summed image
    take a single summed image while scanning the MB delay to integrate over the speed distribution in the incident beam
    do a kinetic scan with a new image at each step of the delay generator scan, link delay value to fame (absolute top priority once hardware is working but not the first thing to do for the software)
    save the image(s) what format?


Control laser
    scan range - start, finish, step size (tell the kinetic scan how many steps it will be), dwell time (tell the camera), write wavelength so that we know what is corresponding image frame
    go to wavelength
